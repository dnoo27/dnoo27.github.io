            <h5>This project is based on data from the Filene report: Not Credit Union Kind of People: Why the Politically Disengaged Shun Credit Unions and What Credit Unions Can Do About It, by

            <h2>What can credit unions learn from the “politically-disengaged”?  </h2>
            <p>Non-voters, or the “politically disengaged” don’t like credit unions. While political disengagement is a societal problem, it seems to have little direct relevance for credit unions. After all, credit unions are nonpartisan organizations that, for the most part, stay out of the political fray to the extent they can. Additionally, credit unions pride themselves on being broad-based, mission-driven organizations that meet the needs of the entire community regardless of any individual's political affiliation. And in fact, past research [hyperlink to Pub#470 Who Do CUs belong to] has shown that credit unions are not partisan institutions, and citizens do not view them as such. They are appreciated and supported by Democrats and Republicans alike.  </p>

         <div data-aos="zoom-in"><p>These differences extend into deeper perceptions that people have about the role that credit unions play in their communities and their faith in what credit unions stand for. More than any other financial institutions, credit unions pride themselves on having leaders who put their members' needs first, rather than prioritizing themselves. Yet here too, voters and nonvoters see things differently. In general, people who know what credit unions are agreed that credit unions are living up to these values. However, once again, voters were more positive about credit union leaders than nonvoters.  </p></div>

         <div data-aos="zoom-in"><p>Despite the question being entirely hypothetical and about an organization that they believed does not exist, voters were bubbling with optimism, with 60% believing leaders of this hypothetical institution would look out for their members as compared with only 41% of nonvoters.
